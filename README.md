üö¶ 2-Way Traffic Light Controller using PIC16F877A
This project implements a 2-way traffic light controller using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system simulates real-world traffic signal operation at a crossroad, using LEDs to represent traffic lights and a 7-segment display for countdown timers. It also supports manual control via start/stop buttons and an alternate display mode for maintenance or testing.

üìå Features
Simulates 2-way traffic control: Direction A and Direction B

Uses LEDs to represent RED, YELLOW, and GREEN traffic signals

Displays countdown timer on a 7-segment display

Manual start/stop control using input buttons

Alternate mode toggle for LED flashing pattern

üß∞ Hardware Requirements
PIC16F877A microcontroller

20 MHz Crystal Oscillator

6 x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green for each direction)

7-Segment display (Common cathode)

Resistors (220Œ© ‚Äì 330Œ©)

Tactile Push Buttons (Start, Stop, Mode)

Breadboard or PCB

5V regulated power supply

üíª Software Requirements
MPLAB X IDE

XC8 Compiler

(Optional) Proteus for simulation

üß† Working Principle
The program continuously monitors the START (RC0) and STOP (RC1) buttons. If START is pressed and STOP is not, it initiates the traffic light cycle:

Direction A:

Green ON (RD3), Yellow (RD2), Red for B (RD0)

Countdown displayed using num15 on 7-segment

Direction A:

Yellow ON (RD4)

Countdown using num3

Direction B:

Green ON (RD5), Red for A (RD0)

Countdown using num20

The STOP button (RC1) interrupts the cycle, entering idle mode. In this state, pressing the mode button (RC2) toggles between two LED display patterns for testing or maintenance.
